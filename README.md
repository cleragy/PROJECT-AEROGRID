## Dataset Description
The project utilizes real-world terrain and clutter data from telecom sectors, augmented with geospatial data(Satelite data). The dataset includes:
- Terrain types (e.g., mountains, plains)
- Clutter types (e.g., urban, vegetation, water bodies)
- Signal strength measurements and other network parameters
